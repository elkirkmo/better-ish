# Better Ish

This is a minmal Fitbit watchface that tells approximate time rounded to the nearest full ten.

It's for those that want to know what time it is, kinda.

If you need to know precise time (to the minute), simply tap on the display to toggle precision mode, which displays the exact time and date. Tap again to switch back into ~ish mode.
